# [000.rip](https://000.rip)

> Link Sharing Service (URL Shortener) Built With [IHP](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/)

## Motivation

At [East Coast Mining](https://eastcoastmining.com) we use a decentralized and immutable file hosting platform.
Immutable meaning, when you upload a file, you receive a hash string as identifier for your file.
Suppose you have a word document, and you edit that document, that means a new hash string, however you want to share the latest version of that document.
That is a why `000.rip` was created, to point a sharable short link to another link on the internet.
